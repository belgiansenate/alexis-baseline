The Belgian Senate is an important institution that generates a large quantity of official documents every year, such as laws, ordinances, declarations and reports. These documents contain valuable and often complex information that can be difficult for citizens to understand. This is where a specialized ChatBot can play an important role. Using the latest natural language processing technologies, this ChatBot aims to understand the questions asked by users and provide precise, clear answers based on the documents generated by the Belgian Senate.
